# Conzu.me App for UofTHacks 2017

Goal: to provide a better shopping experience for the user by removing the process of paying at the cash register. 

With Conzu.me, the user has the ability to pay for products they buy at any store (retail primarily) through their phone, present the receipt before they walk out, and done. 

Conzu.me was created during UofTHacks 2017 by [Darshan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darshan-mehta-7462b1b7), [Kent](https://www.linkedin.com/kent-tsuenchy-0b980159), [Jaskiran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaskiran-lamba), and [Raj](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kuzaxe).

** Must be familiar with ionic/cordova & Xcode. 

To run the app, download all files to local system. 'CD' into the Frontend folder and run 'ionic build ios'. 

Open the project file on Xcode and play. 

To view the app on web, run 'ionic serve' - then go to developer tab, and select "Enter Responsive Design Mode". 

Thank you.
